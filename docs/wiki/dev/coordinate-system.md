# Coordinate system

I have chosen my own preference for the engine's coordinate system, described below:

-   *3D coords* uses *left-handed* system. *X+* is right, *Y+* is up, *Z+* is forward.

![][]

-   *Texture coords* *(x = 0, y = 0)* is the *lower-left* corner of the texture

-   *Triangle winding* is *CCW* front and *CW* winding is backside

-   *2D coords* *(x = 0, y = 0)* is the upper-left corner of the screen or image. And *(x = width, y = height)* is the lower-right corner.
